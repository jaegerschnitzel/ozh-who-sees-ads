Manage your ads. Define under what condition they will show (visitor from search engine, old post..). Make more money.

== Description ==

**Who Sees Ads** is an advanced **ad management** plugin that lets you decide who will see your ads, depending on user defined conditions. You can manage ads in your templates (eg *sidebar.php*) or within posts and pages.

For instance, you could consider the following criteria: Is the visitor a regular reader? Does this visitor come from a search engine? Is the visitor currently reading an old post, or something fresh?

The plugin allows for easily creating display rules with a very advanced user interface.

For a more detailed documentation, demo of the interface, and examples of advanced usages of the plugin, please visit its official page: [Who Sees Ads](http://planetozh.com/blog/my-projects/wordpress-plugin-who-sees-ads-control-adsense-display/ "Who Sees Ads")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it compatible with Google / Yahoo Publisher / whatever terms of use ? =

Yes. It does not modify, alter, change or whatever synonym you'd like your Adsense / YPN code.

= Why would I want not to show ads? I want more money! =

It's been proven by various analytic articles that regular readers come to your site for your content, and don't click ads.
On the other hands, new visitors, or people referred to your site by search engines, are likely to click ads.
